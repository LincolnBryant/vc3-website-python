    <h2>VC3 Kickoff Meeting</h2>
    <p>August 7, 2016</p>
    <p>Our official "kickoff" meeting to get the project formally started.  The main theme will be to revisit our vision and proposal, to identify and carve out the “VC3 space” given changes in the community since the proposal, and to prepare for the [NGNS PI workshop](https://www.orau.gov/ngns2016/default.htm).  Expect the meeting will be small and informal with lots of white-boarding.  Success here would be to come out of the meeting with a year 1 program of work and a Fall "capability demonstrator".</p>
